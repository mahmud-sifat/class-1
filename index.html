        <pre>Forty one years ago today
			Two families performed a merge;
			Sweet music was heard upon that day,
			For angels cannot sing a dirge!

			Mark Anthony Cassar Torreggiani
			Said to Myriam Bellizzi:- “I take thee
			“To be my wife for ever and ever;
			“Since you are a teacher you must be so clever!”

       <p><mark>Their guests – around three hundred – witnessed the match;
		For Myriam Bellizzi was quite a catch!
		And after their nuptials were complete
		They hopped across the road in order to eat.</mark></p>
